The hexapod acceleration and velocity changes are not done by stand-alone commands anymore and were, therefore, not tested. Since the state machine of the CSC is still under development and will change to a standbyState-entry state machine, the state machine transitions were only partially tested as needed to conduct the other tests.<br /><br />At the beginning of this verification activity, the hardware of the camera hexapod presented issues in actuators 3 and 6. Both had dead encoder zones that made the hexapod stop immediately. Recovery needed direct intervention at the issue-causing actuator. The problem was solved by taking out <strong>all</strong> actuators and servicing them by cleaning the encoder band from Teflon and grease/oil and reassembling the hexapod. In addition, during the service, the cables to the encoders were found to be damaged due to the movements of the actuators. This triggered a redesign of the actuator heads that is currently ongoing. (see <a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/FRACAS-28\">FRACAS-28\u00a0</a>for the actuator 3 failure and <a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/FRACAS-54\">FRACAS-54\u00a0</a>for the actuator 6 failure).<br /><br />Though not directly part of this verification testing, a random failure (a feedback fault in Drive 0 and Drive 2) caused significant delays during test execution. The encoders inside of the actuators as well as the drives themselves, were first suspected as the cause for the failure. The actuators could be excluded as the origin of the fault by exchanging the cabling between the actuators. The drives did not present any obvious failure reason. The issue was solved after finishing this test by exchanging the cables to one actuator and testing that this solution could be reproduced by changing the cable from between the drives. All cables were exchanged. The problem did not appear again.<br /><br />Apart from the aforementioned issues, the camera hexapod did not reach the XYZ accuracy as required (<a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/LVV-19501\">LVV-19501)\u00a0</a>at the beginning of the testing campaign.<br />This hardware-related issue concerns the following requirements<ul><li><a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/LVV-18622\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LTS-206-REQ-0164-V-02: 3.5.12_1 Positioning - LSST Re-verification</a> <a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/LVV-18631\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li><li><a href=\"https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/LVV-18631\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LTS-206-REQ-0178-V-02: 3.5.24_1 Hexapod Absolute Accuracy - LSST Re-verification</a>.</li></ul>Specifically, the tests on the positioning in X, Y, and Z translation combined with rotation failed to reach the required precision.
